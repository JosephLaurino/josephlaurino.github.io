As a husband and as a father, I have transitioned away from a career focused solely on myself.  Five years or so ago, I reasoned with myself that thereâ€™s a need to make our world a better place for the next generation.  I've been lucky to find out that my career in video games translates well to the world of envisioning and incubation.  Music Ministry and benefit concerts opened the doors of finding a sense of accomplishment through acts of volunteering. 

Most seek happiness, I recommend seeking contentedness. 

And from the abundant well, one can start to zoom out and see the bigger picture.
