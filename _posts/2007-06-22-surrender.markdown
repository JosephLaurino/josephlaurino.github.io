Surrender to your freedom song, one  
that can only be sung when you let go of  
the things that hold you back  

Knowingly we choose the chains that  
imprison us, for we hide within them  
for fear of surrendering to the  
uncertainties of freewill  

In the infinite possibilites, our simple minds  
can only comprehend what we believe  
to have been predetermined beforehand...  

Uncertain bird, if you were meant to be  
a windvane, you would have been born so...
