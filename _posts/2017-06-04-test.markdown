When I joined a few start-ups as well as when I took a chance and started my own, I read a ton of books on many topics (business, team development, project management, etc) that were outside of my college education.  I also reached out to people who could give me advice.  

I had to do this since I was out of my element.

When I got married and later had kids, I did a similar approach.  My limited knowledge of marriage from what I observed from my parents, friends and pop culture was not enough.  My wife and I read a few books on the topic as well as attended a few marriage retreats.  

Now I'm reading a book on how to raise sons. 

Family is the primary community that we belong to and we need to strive to continually make it better. The start-up approach of continuous learning is a good approach from my experience.

Kahlil Gibran “On Children” excerpt...

You may give them your love but not your thoughts,   
For they have their own thoughts  
You may house their bodies but not their souls,  
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,   
which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams  
You may strive to be like them,  
but seek not to make them like you  
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday
