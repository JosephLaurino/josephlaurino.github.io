Many years ago, it was normal for me to allocate over 70/hrs per week for work.  This enabled an acceleration of achievement in the context of shipping products in the game industry which is no small feat.  While this was meaningful especially to my ego, I remembered the inner calling to pursue helping others beyond the context of work - a deeper meaning for my existence.

Since that self reflection, I had the chance to join a music ministry and with the group we were able to “ship” a few benefit concerts that raised money and awareness to causes around social justice.

I then married an amazing person and Amy was able to convince me that we needed to give to charity at least 10% of our income.  This was a tough one since I thought that just being charitable of my time and talent was enough.

Recently we were able to help finish a funding effort for a tiny home to help someone facing homelessness in Seattle.  

We read so much of the darkness of our times and yet we wait for others to step up first. 

While we wait the suffering continues. 

So my family stopped waiting... we now invest heavily beyond just charity and towards a sustainable future which in itself is charity towards our children.
