Luck plays an important role at the micro and macro levels -- where you are born, who you end up marrying, the friends you make.

Since luck lives in the realm of unpredictability, success based on luck is also unpredictable.  But one can optimize for gaining the most out of luck when it does appear by working on fundamentals (investing in education, saving money, making time to develop a support structure).

Another thing to point out is the need for one to start paying attention to when luck is happening at the moment.  This can prove distracting or even anxiety inducing since a choice needs to be made and the path presented by luck is oftentimes counter to the status quo.

When the horizon is unclear, reach out to people who know you, read journals you wrote in the past, contemplate on the aspirations you had as a child.  Those will help in identifying your inner drive. 

The path to success is rewarding not easy.
