Hello World,

My name is Joseph and I'm currently on sabbatical.

Most recently I worked on the [Holodome](http://engineering.vulcan.com/2019_0211_Holodome-On-the-path-to-the-Holodeck.aspx) at Vulcan Inc helping take it from prototype all the way to be a viable product.  The Holodome was deployed at MoPOP in Seattle, WEVR in LA, and at [TED2019](https://blog.ted.com/vulcan-holodome-at-ted2019-an-immersive-360-degree-world-without-a-headset/) in Vancouver, BC.

From 2011-late 2016, I was a member of Microsoft's Technology and Research Strategic Prototyping Team where I worked on ideating and implementing prototypes for senior level executives as well as demos for the [Microsoft Envisioning Center](https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/step-inside-the-microsoft-envisioning-center/#sm.0008wi1b31aojcsjthi2dbr2nh2s0) including the most recent 2016 release. These demos are strategic in nature and serve as examples of how the creative use of technologies can empower people and organizations 3-7 years in the future.

Before Microsoft, I was involved in the game development scene in the Seattle area (Sony Online Entertainment, WildTangent, LithTech, etc.) shipping various games and game engines after graduating from the University of Washington (Computer Science & Engineering) in 1997.

I've also volunteered as a music minister for the Newman Center at UW as well as help organize and produce various benefit concerts.

At home, I do my best to find time to rock out on my Les Paul, cook without recipes and investigate virtual reality, mixed reality and consumer robotics with my sons.

Best,  
Joseph
